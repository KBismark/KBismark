## How many times did I try creating my own reactive web frameworkðŸ˜†?   
So many timesðŸ˜† I can't even tell how many times. Some were left on my laptops without pushing. And the codes, very uglyðŸ˜‚ but achieved the results. The ideas behind creating a framework were good ones though. I learned a lot about the entire web. I got to put my problem solving skills into practice too. All the compilers I built to parse the JSX of the frameworks were built from scratch and RegExp-only compilers. The greatest motivation in those moments were everytime I was able to do what I thought of doing... It kept me challenging myselft to do more.     

**Let me list some here (Latest first):** 
- [Xolus (in 2024)](https://github.com/KBismark/xolus) : JSX template engine and a modern html rendering framework. A link to a full app created with this framework is available on the project's repo.

- [HoneyBee.js (in 2023)](https://github.com/KBismark/honey-bee/blob/master/demo/README.md) : Build your next interactive and reactive multi-page applications with the latest but fastest librabry: HoneyBee.js.

- [TheNext (in 2023)](https://github.com/KBismark/thenext) : This repo uses one framework I created called Breakerjs.

- [JSHON (in 2023)](https://github.com/KBismark/jshon) : Build world-class web apps with JavaScript-Html Object Notation (JSHON).

- [Festjs (in 2022)](https://github.com/KBismark/festjs) : Build fast, reactive and reusable components for the web. **This is when it all started!ðŸ˜†**

## Can't leave out my first biggest work. NoscDB!
This project taught me a lot about Nodejs. NoscDB was an attempt to create a database management system using JavaScript. Data were stored as JSON values in files using the Nodejs File System `fs` module. It was fast because of the Non-blocking and Asynchronous nature of nodejs applications. It included a server module that could be hosted and client module that could be used to communicate or retrieve data from the hosted server. Noscdb itself could also act as both the client and hosted server to be used in anu nodejs application. [Here is a link to my start of JavaScript and Nodejs programming. NoscDB](https://github.com/KBismark/noscdb).    

[Code Chat (Web application)](https://github.com/KBismark/CodeChat) was a test to see how NoscDB would perform in applications. Try it out.
