## How many times did I try creating my own reactive web frameworkðŸ˜†?   
I can't even tell how many times. So many timesðŸ˜† Some were left on my laptops without pushing. And the codes, very uglyðŸ˜‚ but I achieved the results. The ideas behind creating a framework were good ones though. I learned a lot about the entire web. Got to use my Nodejs and JavaScript skills into practice too. All the compilers I built to parse the JSX of the many frameworks were built from scratch and RegExp-only compilers. The greatest motivation in those moments were everytime I was able to do what I thought of doing... It kept me challenging myselft to do more.    

**Let me list some here (Latest first):** 
- [Xolos](https://github.com/KBismark/xolus) : JSX template engine and a modern html rendering framework. A link to a full app created with this framework is available on the project's repo.
